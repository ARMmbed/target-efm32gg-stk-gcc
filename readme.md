## Yotta Target Description using GCC to compile for STK3700 Devkit

This target is useful for comparing the compilation of things with gcc vs clang
(the compiler used in target-stk3700).

**Only plain C/C++ is supported. Objective-C code will not compile with GCC!**

Debug commands are as described in [target-stk3700](https://github.com/ARM-RD/target-stk3700).
